## Sprint 3 (Version 2.1)

Sprint 3 focuses on modernizing the user experience and expanding gameplay depth through new interaction methods and advanced role logic.

Completed features include:
- Added the **Fortune Teller** role (Civilian faction).
- Implemented the `/divine` command, allowing players to investigate a target's role during the Night phase.
- Integrated divination success tracking into the global scoring and stats system.
- Implemented a dynamic **Day Counter** (e.g., "DAY 1", "DAY 2") to help players track game progress.
- Implemented randomized **Death & Save stories** to provide unique flavor text for every morning phase.
- Implemented an automated role displaying system where users receive a DM once the game starts, displaying their role, custom role-card images, and commands.

## Commands

### Mafia Game
- `/join` Join the Mafia game (starts recruitment if no game is active)
- `/role` View your Mafia role (private)
- `/vote <user>` Vote to eliminate a player (Day phase only)
- `/kill <user>` Mafia: eliminate a player (Night phase only)
- `/save <user>` Doctor: protect a player (Night phase only)
- `/divine <user>` Fortune Teller: Investigate a player's role (Night phase only).

- `/stats` Show player stats across all games and recent games

## Game State Management

The bot uses a centralized game state system to ensure match integrity.

Key protections include:
- Active game locking to prevent mid-match resets
- Phase tracking (Pre-Game, Night, Day, Ended)
- Alive player tracking to enforce communication restrictions
- Automatic cleanup and state reset after win conditions

These systems ensure a stable multiplayer experience and prevent state corruption during gameplay.

## Stats Tracking
The bot tracks lifetime player stats across matches and stores them persistently in:
- data/stats.json

Recent games are recorded using per-game snapshots so /stats can show what happened in the last matches.

Note:
- The data/ folder is runtime output and should not be committed to git. Add `data/` to .gitignore.
