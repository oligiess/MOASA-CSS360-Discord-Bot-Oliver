## Mafia Game Engine: State Management & Game Logic
Overview
The Mafia game is the core functionality of the MOASA bot. It utilizes a Stateful Event-Driven Architecture, where the bot tracks the game's progression (Day/Night phases) and player statuses in real-time.

Feature Description
The game manages complex interactions including role assignment, secret voting, and win-condition checks. Unlike simple one-off commands, the Mafia game requires a persistent Game State to transition between different phases based on user input and timed events.

Data Flow
Game Initialization: Users use /start to trigger the game logic.

Role Assignment: The bot assigns roles (Mafia, Doctor, Citizen) and updates the Datastore.

Phase Cycle:

Night Phase: Mafia and Doctor submit actions via DMs or private channels.

Day Phase: Players discuss and vote via slash commands in the public channel.

Processing: The Decision Logic checks if the voting threshold is met.

State Update: Upon execution or murder, the bot updates the player's "Alive" status in the Datastore.

Win Condition Check: After each phase, the bot evaluates if the number of Mafia members equals or exceeds the number of Citizens.

Architecture Diagram (System Context & Flow)
The Mafia logic follows a circular flow where user interactions continuously update the internal Game State Storage, which then determines the next outcome displayed to the Discord channel.

Architectural Significance
The Mafia game engine highlights the bot's ability to handle Asynchronous State Transitions.

Modularity: The game logic is decoupled from the Discord API wrapper, allowing for easier debugging of game rules.

Persistence: By using a dedicated state storage, the bot can maintain game integrity even when multiple events (like simultaneous votes) occur.
